      <p className="mb-6">
        This Cookie Policy explains how Unwrapza uses cookies and similar technologies to operate and improve our website.
        By using Unwrapza, you consent to the cookies described below.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help websites function properly 
        and provide usage insights. Cookies used on Unwrapza do not identify you personally.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Cookies We Use</h2>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-1">2.1 Functional Cookies</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        These cookies are essential for operating the website. They enable navigation, preferences, and stable performance. 
        They cannot be disabled as the site will not function correctly without them.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-1">2.2 Analytics Cookies (Anonymous)</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        These cookies help us understand how users interact with Unwrapza, including page views, search queries, and product clicks. 
        All analytics data is anonymous and used solely to improve the website.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold mb-1">2.3 Affiliate Tracking Cookies</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When you click a product link that redirects to a retailer (e.g., bol.com), that retailer may place an affiliate cookie. 
        These cookies track referrals so that we may earn a commission. They do not collect personal data and are controlled by retailers.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Third-party cookies may be set by retailers we link to. Unwrapza does not control these cookies. Users should review 
        the cookie policies of the retailer's website.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. You Have Control Over Cookies</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You can block or delete cookies through your browser settings. However, disabling cookies may affect website functionality, 
        particularly affiliate redirects.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. No Advertising or Personal Tracking</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Unwrapza does not use marketing cookies, personal tracking cookies, or retargeting technologies. Only functional, anonymous 
        analytics, and affiliate tracking cookies are used.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may update this Cookie Policy occasionally. Continued use of Unwrapza indicates acceptance of any changes.
