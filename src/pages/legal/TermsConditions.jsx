      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Unwrapza is a gift-discovery platform that displays products from external retailers such as bol.com and 
        other affiliate partners. We do not sell products directly. All purchases are completed on the retailer’s website.
      </p>

        By using Unwrapza, you accept these Terms & Conditions and agree to comply with them.
      </p>

        You may use Unwrapza only for personal, non-commercial purposes. You agree not to misuse or disrupt the website, 
        scrape content, bypass tracking systems, or engage in illegal activity. We may restrict access if rules are violated.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. External Retailers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Unwrapza displays products from independent retailers. We are not responsible for order processing, shipping, 
        product quality, refunds, warranty, or pricing. All purchases occur directly between you and the retailer.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Product Information Accuracy</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Product information may change and is provided by external retailers. Unwrapza cannot guarantee accuracy or 
        completeness. Always verify details on the retailer’s website before purchasing.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Affiliate Links</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Unwrapza participates in affiliate programs and may earn commissions from purchases made through affiliate links. 
        These commissions never increase your price and do not influence product ranking.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Privacy & Cookies</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your use of Unwrapza is governed by our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Affiliate Disclaimer, which explain 
        data usage and affiliate tracking.
      </p>
